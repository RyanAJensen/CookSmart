# AI Recipe Caching - Ingredient Addition Based

## How It Works

The AI recipe generation system uses an intelligent caching mechanism with **persistent storage** that only regenerates recipes when ingredients are **deliberately added** to the pantry.

### Key Principles

1. **Recipes persist across navigation** - Users can switch tabs and return without losing generated recipes
2. **Recipes persist across app sessions** - Cache survives app restarts and navigation
3. **New ingredients trigger regeneration** - Adding an ingredient automatically generates fresh recipes
4. **Manual regeneration available** - Users can still force new recipes with "Generate New Recipes" button
5. **No redundant API calls** - Prevents unnecessary generation when just browsing

## Implementation Details

### Cache Manager (`services/aiRecipeCache.ts`)
- Global state manager with AsyncStorage persistence
- Tracks when ingredients are added with persistent invalidation flags
- Provides subscription system for components to listen for cache invalidation
- Stores actual recipe data persistently across app sessions

### Integration Points

1. **Food Details Modal** (`app/(modals)/food-details.tsx`)
   - Calls `aiRecipeCacheManager.invalidateCache()` when ingredient is added
   - Triggers cache invalidation immediately after successful ingredient addition

2. **Recipes Screen** (`app/recipes.tsx`)
   - Initializes cache manager on mount
   - Subscribes to cache invalidation events
   - Checks cache status before generating recipes
   - Uses persistent cached recipes when no new ingredients detected

### User Experience Flow

1. **First Visit to AI Recipes**
   - No cache exists â†’ Generates new recipes
   - Caches recipes for future use

2. **Navigation Away and Back**
   - Uses cached recipes â†’ No API call
   - Shows "ðŸ“‹ Using existing recipes (add ingredients for new recipes)"

3. **Adding New Ingredient**
   - Cache invalidated automatically
   - Next visit to AI Recipes â†’ Generates fresh recipes
   - Shows "ðŸ†• New ingredient detected! Generating fresh AI recipes..."

4. **Manual Regeneration**
   - "Generate New Recipes" button bypasses cache
   - Forces new generation regardless of cache state

## Status Messages

- `ðŸ¤– Generating AI recipes from your pantry...` - Initial generation
- `ðŸ†• New ingredient detected! Generating fresh AI recipes...` - New ingredient added
- `ðŸ“‹ Using existing recipes (add ingredients for new recipes)` - Using cache
- `âœ¨ AI recipes generated successfully!` - Generation completed

## Benefits

- **Reduced API Usage**: No redundant calls when pantry unchanged
- **Better UX**: Instant recipe display on return visits and app restarts
- **Intuitive Behavior**: New recipes only when pantry changes
- **Persistent Cache**: Recipes survive app sessions and navigation
- **Flexible**: Manual regeneration still available

## Testing

1. Generate AI recipes with some ingredients
2. Navigate away and back â†’ Should use cached recipes
3. Add new ingredient â†’ Should automatically generate fresh recipes
4. Use "Generate New Recipes" â†’ Should bypass cache
